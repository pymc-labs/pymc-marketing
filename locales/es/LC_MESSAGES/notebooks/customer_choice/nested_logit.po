"We've seen how the Multinomial Logit model suffers from the IIA "
"limitation that leads to implausible counterfactual inferences regarding "

"The important addition gained through the nested logit specification is "
"the ability to specify \"nests\" of products in this way we can partition"
" the market into \"natural\" groups of competing products ensuring that "
"there is an inherent bias in the model towards a selective pattern of "
"preference. As before we specify the models using formulas, but now we "

"We will dwell a bit on the manner in which these nests are specified and "
"why. The nested logit model partitions the choice set into nests of "
"alternatives that share common unobserved attributes (i.e., are more "
"similar to each other). It computes the overall probability of choosing "
"an alternative as the product of (1) The probability of choosing a nest "
"(marginal probability), and (2) the probability of choosing an "
"alternative within that nest (conditional probability, given that nest). "
"In our case we want to isolate the probability of choosing a central "
"heatings system and a room based heating system."

"Causal inference is hard and predicting the counterfactual actions of "
"agents in a competitive market is very hard. There is no guarantee that a"
" nested logit model will accurately represent the choice of any "
"particular agent, but you can be hopeful that it highlights expected "
"patterns of choice when the nesting structure reflects the natural "
"segmentation of a market. Nests should group alternatives that share "
"unobserved similarities, ideally driven by a transparent theory of the "
"market structure. Well-specified nests should show stronger substitution "
"within nests than across nests, and you can inspect the substitution "
"patterns as above. Ideally you can always try and hold out some test data"
" to evaluate the implications of your fitted model. Discrete choice "
"models are causal inference models and their structural specification "
"should support generalisable inference across future and counterfactual "
"situations."
