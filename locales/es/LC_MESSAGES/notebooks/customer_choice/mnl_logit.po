"Discrete choice models are widely applied in fields like transportation, "
"marketing, and health economics to understand behavior and inform policy "
"or design. Common variants include the multinomial logit, nested logit, "
"and mixed logit models, each capturing different aspects of choice "
"behavior, such as similarity among alternatives or individual "
"heterogeneity. In this notebook we will demonstrate how to specify the "
"multinomial logit model and highlight a property of this model known as "
"the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives."

"The general idea of these models is that an individualsâ€™ choices among "
"observed alternatives reflect the maximization of an underlying utility "
"function. In this framework, each alternative in a choice set is "
"associated with a latent utility composed of observable components (e.g.,"
" cost, travel time) and unobservable factors captured as random errors. "
"Daniel McFadden formalized this approach using random utility models, "
"including the multinomial logit model, which assumes that the unobserved "
"components of utility follow an extreme value distribution. His models "
"provided a rigorous econometric foundation for analyzing choice behavior "
"from observed decisions, enabling estimation of how changes in attributes"
" influence choice probabilities. This work earned McFadden the Nobel "
"Prize in Economics in 2000 and has had lasting influence in "
"transportation, marketing, and labor economics."

"To specify our multinomial logit model we therefore specify the form of "
"the utility equations that might drive consumers to purchase particular "
"goods amongst a choice set. Note how we distinguish each of the "
"individual alternatives and the alternative-specific-covariates and the "
"individual-specific-covariates by using the `|` notation. This is a "
"variant of the standard Wilkinson stlye formula notation for specifying "
"regression models. Under the hood we fit N regression models for each of "
"the N goods. These regressions are used to generate a Utility score which"
" is fed through a softmax transform to give us probabilities of each "
"particular choice. The most probable choice should be the one with the "
"greatest predicted utility."

" of if their is an inherent market bias among that consumer base towards "
"the more eco-friendly heat pump systems?"
