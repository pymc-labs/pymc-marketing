"This notebook showcases how to use the Multivariate Interrupted Time "
"Series (MVITS) model to estimate where new product sales came from in the"
" case of an unsaturated market. That is, when a new product can lead to "
"(some) reductions in sales of existing products, but some of the new "
"product sales are in the form of growing the market."

"So the total sales increase, but importantly, those additional sales are "
"directed to the new product. This is likely a pretty common scenario in "
"the real world. A new product is released and perhaps it is far better "
"than existing products. So if it sells 1000 units, then some of those "
"sales will be 'taken' from sales of existing products, but the new "
"product is so good that it attracts new customers that would not have "
"purchased any of the existing products. This could happen if the new "
"product falls below a psychologically significant price point, or is "
"associated with new marketing, or simply has a new feature that attracts "
"new customers."
