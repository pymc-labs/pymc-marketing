"Causal identification is about figuring out if we can prove a cause-and-"
"effect relationship using the data we have and our assumptions. This "
"process helps us establish clear links between different factors instead "
"of looking at their correlations. It is essential when working with "
"observational data, which can be affected by hidden factors and biases "
"that make it hard to see true causal relationships."
