"We've introduced a simple but powerful tool for probing deeper into your "
"MMM results. You can explore a sweep of perterbations to one or more "
"driver variables and compute the expected outcomes and marginal effects "
"for each scenario. You can consider different forms of peterbation, here "
"we've shown multiplicative, absolute and additive sweeps."

"This allows you to answer \"what if\" questions with precision and "
"clarity, providing actionable insights into how different levers affect "
"your business outcomes. You can produce simple and interpretable plots "
"that you can use to communicate how the model works and get sense-checks "
"on the model's behaviour and assumptions."
