"In the domain of Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM), understanding the impact "
"of various marketing activities on a target variable and other key "
"performance indicators is crucial. Traditional regression models often "
"neglect the temporal dynamics of marketing activities, potentially "
"leading to biased or incomplete insights. This notebook aims to showcase "
"the difference between a conventional regression model that does not "
"account for time variation and a more sophisticated model that "
"incorporates time as a key component through a Gaussian process."
