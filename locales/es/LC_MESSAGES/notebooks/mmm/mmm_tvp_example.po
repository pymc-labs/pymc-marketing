"If you suspect that your baseline sales fluctuate over time due to "
"factors beyond seasonality, constant growth, or explicitly modeled "
"controls, consider using a time-varying parameter. The time-varying "
"intercept is like a _catch-all_ for unexplained variance in your sales "
"data."

"We have defined some sensible defaults, and in most cases, they are "
"adequate. But if you have unexplained variance in your sales that occur "
"on short time scales, you may‚Äîas in the example above‚Äîexperiment with "
"lowering the length-scale prior mean. If you need greater fidelity in the"
" frequencies that the GP can capture, and can live with longer sampling "
"times, you can also increase the number of basis functions "
"`model_config['intercept_tvp_config'].m` from 200 (default) to a higher "
"number. Finally, if you believe you have events affecting your sales on, "
"say, two separate time scales, you can supply a new covariance function "
"through `model_config['intercept_tvp_config'].cov_func`, which is *the "
"sum of two independently defined covariance functions*‚Äîeach with a "
"length-scale prior mean that matches the given time scales you expect in "
"your data."
