"Notice in the bottom plot that the causal impact of the campaign "
"continues on for a short duration after the campaign as ended. This is a "
"direct result of the adstock function in the MMM which models the lagged "
"effect of media spend on sales. Similarly, there is a slight lag effect "
"at the start of the campaign. There is also noise in the causal impact - "
"this makes sense because the way how we similated this data was based on "
"changes in media spend, not on a specified level of sales difference."
