"For a variety of reasons, companies often need to quantify the monetary "
"value of each customer (present and future) and do so while acknowledging"
" the entire relationship the customer has with the company.  This value "
"represents the maximum the company should spend on acquiring new "
"customers.  It may also guide customer retention efforts and inform "
"financial forecasting."

"A simplistic approach to calculating customer value might be to calculate"
" how much value (e.g., revenue, profit) was derived from former customers"
" and assume that future customers will yield similar value.  "
"Unfortunately, this and other intuitive approaches treat all customers as"
" equivalent and fail to accurately characterize the nature of the "
"relationshiop: this approach will not distinguish between a customer that"
" makes large, infrequent purchases and a customer that makes small, "
"frequent purchases."

"Fortunately, with Bayesian modeling, we can do better than this! Customer"
" Lifetime Value (CLV) models can estimate various aspects of each "
"customer's relationship with the company, project these estimates into "
"the future for forecasting purposes, and quantify the value of the "
"customer over the entire lifetime (past and future).  These estimates can"
" then be utilized for marketing and financial purposes."

"Guide marketing campaigns.  Knowing what kinds of customers are most (and"

"customers."

"Guide retention and reacquisition efforts. Estimates of current "
"customers' future value can be used to automate aspects of the company's "

"prioritized. Retention campaigns can target customers at risk of churning"
" (terminating their relationship with the company).  Reacquisition "
"campaigns can target high-value customers who have already churned."

"Avoid being misled by other factors. Without a broad, all encompassing "
"way of valuing customers, companies may focus on KPIs that provide "
"incomplete picture.  For example, companies may focus on the total number"
" of customers acquired without realizing that many are low-value. Or "
"companies may focus on the average revenue generated by a customer, "
"without a good way of building forecasts of future behavior."

"Customer lifetime value models come in two basic varieties: contractual "
"and non-contractual.  When customer relationships are contractual (e.g., "
"subscription-based), the CLV modeling tends to be a bit more "
"straightforward because the company always knows the status of the "
"customer relationship (i.e., the relationship is ongoing or has been "
"terminated). When the relationship is non-contractual, the status of the "
"relationship is always uncertain."

"The revenue model characterizes the rate at which individual customers "
"\"buy\" (i.e., generate transactions) and the magnitude of those "
"purchases.  Typically, we can think about of an individual customer "
"making purchases at a relatively steady rate (e.g., once per month). Of "
"course, the actual timing of purchases will vary somewhat and we will be "
"more confident about the rates associated with customers who have "
"purchased many times in the past. The same is true of the magnitude of "
"purchases.  Our estimates of frequency and magnitude allow us to "
"characterize how many purchases to expect from a customer in the future "
"and how large those purchases will be.  Together, this allows us to "
"quantify the revenue expected from a customer if the relationship "
"continued into the future."

"Unfortunately, not all customer relationships last forever.  The second "
"component allows us to model the expected duration of the customer "
"relationship.  With contractual relationships, customers may voluntarily "
"churn at the end of contract periods (e.g., deciding not to renew a "
"subscription) and CLV models estimate the probability with which a given "
"customer does or does not do so.  With non-contractual customer "
"relationships, things are trickier. If a customer tends to make a "
"purchase once per month and hasn't done so for 6 weeks, should we assume "
"the customer has churned? Or perhaps this is just part of the typical "
"variability in this customer's behavior. Either way, CLV models permit us"
" to evaluate the probability that a given customer will continue to be a "
"customer at some given time in the future and the total lifetime of each "
"customer."
