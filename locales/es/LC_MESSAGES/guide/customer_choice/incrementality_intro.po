"Let's say your company sells many products into a busy market with many "

"We might be tempted to think of cannibalistic sales as 'bad'. But this "
"need not be the case, it depends entirely on your product strategy. For "
"example, it could be that you want to constantly improve your product "
"line up, releasing products with better attributes which are superior to "
"competitors. In this case, you would expect sales of older products to "
"decrease as customers switch to the new products. This can be a desirable"

"To be more precise, we aren't really able to make this causal inference "
"based on the sales data _before_ new product introduction. Instead, we do"
" it by comparing the actual product sales after the new product "
"introduction to a counterfactual scenario where the new product was not "
"introduced. This is the essence of causal inference in product "
"incrementality. The question is how do we calculate the counterfactual "
"sales?"

"In the trivially simple example above where sales are highly stable over "

"In fact, in many markets it is likely even more complex. We might not be "
