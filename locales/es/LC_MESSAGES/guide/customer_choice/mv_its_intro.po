"One modeling approach we could use for causal analysis of product "
"incrementality is the multivariate interrupted time series (MV-ITS) "
"model. This model is a generalization of the interrupted time series "
"model (ITS), which is a common approach in causal inference. The MV-ITS "
"model allows us to estimate the causal impact of an intervention (e.g., a"
" new product introduction) on multiple outcomes (e.g., sales of multiple "
"products) simultaneously."
