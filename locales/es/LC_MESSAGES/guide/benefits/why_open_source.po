"PyMC-Marketing and [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/) (the Bayesian engine that"
" powers PyMC-Marketing) are supported by a large, active community of "
"developers who contribute to the development of these libraries and "
"provide support and guidance to users. For example the [the PyMC-"
"Marketing Discussions on Github](https://github.com/pymc-labs/pymc-"
"marketing/discussions) allows members of our community to connect with "
"and ask questions of peers, core developers, and members of [PyMC "
"Labs](https://www.pymc-labs.com).  The [PyMC "
"Discouse](https://discourse.pymc.io) is a similar forum for users of PyMC"
" (the engine that powers PyMC-Marketing). This thriving community can be "
"invaluable for businesses that don't have the resources to hire their own"
