"Data such as customer transactions and advertising expenditure can be low"
" resolution (e.g. monthly), contain measurement errors, and have missing "
"values. This kind of noisy data environment can be a challenge for "
"traditional methods that rely solely upon data to draw their conclusions."

"Bayesian approaches allow your team’s valuable domain expertise to be "
"incorporated in the modelling process in the form of Bayesian prior "
"beliefs. This can make a massive difference - especially when data are "
"noisy and uncertain. Rather than your model contorting itself in strange "
"ways to best fit complex and noisy data, Bayesian priors can keep your "
"model right, leading to much more sensible insights that fit with your "
"domain expertise."

"Frequentist approaches can require two or more years worth of historical "
"data. Bayesian methods can work with very short-run data, meaning you "
"don't have to wait a long time collecting data before getting insights. "
"The certainty in your estimates will grow as your dataset increases."

"Bayesian approaches excel at modelling hierarchical or nested data. This "
"is particularly useful if you have just launched a new product, or "
"operate in a new region, or are dealing with a new cohort or demographic "
"of customers and don’t have many observations. Bayesian hierarchical "
"models allow information learnt about some categories to intelligently "
"inform you about novel categories."

"Bayesian methods provide *the* way to make decisions under uncertainty. "
"This enables you to generate and predict future scenarios - knowing how "
"certain or not you are of those predictions. You can run optimisation "
"processes to decide what actions to take in the future, fully taking "
"uncertainty into account. This helps manage your risk."
