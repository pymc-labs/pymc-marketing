"In this talk I will present two new open-source packages that make up a "
"powerful and state-of-the-art marketing analytics toolbox. Specifically, "
"PyMC-Marketing is a new library built on top of the popular Bayesian "
"modeling library PyMC. PyMC-Marketing allows robust estimation of "
"customer acquisition costs (via media mix modeling) as well as customer "
"lifetime value. In addition, I will show how we can estimate the "
"effectiveness of marketing campaigns using a new Bayesian causal "
"inference package called CausalPy. The talk will be applied with a real-"
"world case-study and many code examples. Special emphasis will be placed "
"on the interplay between these tools and how they can be combined "
"together to make optimal marketing budget decisions in complex scenarios."
