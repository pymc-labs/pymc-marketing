"2000s: The digital revolution introduced new challenges and "
"opportunities. MMMs had to adapt to incorporate digital channels and deal"
" with the increased complexity of the media landscape."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/guide/mmm/mmm_intro.md:51 14ec16c6d19b485eb0f2ce22bbb3f9fe

"2010s: Big data and machine learning techniques began to be incorporated "

"Rather than model our KPI as a linear function of marketing spend, the "

"While the initial money spent on an advertising channel might have a big "
"impact on customer acquisition, further investment will often lead to "
"diminishing returns as people get used to the message. When we think "
"about optimization, modeling this effect is critical. Some channels may "

"customer acquisitions for spending for that channel. Knowing the "
"saturation of each channel is vital in making future marketing spend "
