"If there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping Unicode "
"ordinals (integers) or characters to Unicode ordinals, strings or None. "
"Character keys will be then converted to ordinals. If there are two "
"arguments, they must be strings of equal length, and in the resulting "
"dictionary, each character in x will be mapped to the character at the "
"same position in y. If there is a third argument, it must be a string, "
"whose characters will be mapped to None in the result."
