Utility functions for Bayesian optimization.

Key Concepts:
-------------

- **Samples**:
    A PyTensor tensor variable (`pt.TensorVariable`) representing samples drawn from the posterior
    distributions of the model outputs. These samples capture the uncertainty in the model predictions
    and are essential for computing expected utilities and risk measures in Bayesian optimization.

- **Budgets**:
    A PyTensor tensor variable representing a set of monetary budgets allocated to different assets,
    investments, or channels. Each element corresponds to the budget for a specific option in the
    optimization process.

def portfolio_entropy(

    R"""
    Calculate the entropy of a portfolio's asset weights to assess diversification.

    Portfolio entropy, derived from Shannon entropy in information theory, quantifies
    the dispersion of asset weights within a portfolio. A higher entropy value indicates
    a more diversified portfolio, as investments are more evenly distributed across assets.
    Conversely, a lower entropy suggests concentration in fewer assets, implying higher risk.

    The entropy is calculated using the formula:

    .. math::
        E = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot \log(w_i)

    where :math:`w_i` represents the weight of asset \( i \) in the portfolio.

    R"""
    Calculate the Diversification Ratio of a portfolio to evaluate risk distribution.

    The Diversification Ratio measures the effectiveness of diversification by comparing
    the weighted average volatility of individual assets to the overall portfolio volatility.
    A higher ratio indicates better diversification, as it reflects lower correlations among
    assets, leading to reduced portfolio risk.

    The Diversification Ratio is calculated as:

    samples : pt.TensorVariable
        2D PyTensor tensor variable where each column represents the returns of an asset.

    contribute to the overall portfolio risk.
