"""Components for media transformation in the MMM model.

Examples
--------
Use custom transformations for media in the MMM model:

.. code-block:: python

    from pymc_marketing.prior import Prior
    from pymc_marketing.mmm import (
        SaturationTransformation,
        MMM,
        WeibullPDFAdstock,
    )

    class InfiniteReturns(SaturationTransformation):
        def function(self, x, b):
            return b * x

        default_priors = {"b": Prior("HalfNormal")}


    saturation = InfiniteReturns()
    adstock = WeibullPDFAdstock(l_max=15)

    mmm = MMM(
        ...,
        saturation=saturation,
        adstock=adstock,
        adstock_first=True,
    )
