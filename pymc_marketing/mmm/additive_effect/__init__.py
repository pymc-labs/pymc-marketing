Additive effects submodule.

This submodule provides classes for modeling additive effects within the PyMC Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) framework.

It exposes the following components:
    - Model: The main class for specifying additive effect models.
    - MuEffect: A class representing the mean effect in additive models.

Typical usage involves importing these classes to construct and analyze additive effect models in marketing analytics.
