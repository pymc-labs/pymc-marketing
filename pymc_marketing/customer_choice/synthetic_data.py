    This function generates synthetic data for the MVITS model, assuming that the market is

    Parameters
    ----------

        The average level of sales in the market.
    total_sales_sigma: float
        The standard deviation of sales in the market.

    n_observations: int
        The number of observations to generate.
    market_shares_before: list[float]
        The market shares before the introduction of the new model.
    market_shares_after: list[float]

    -------
