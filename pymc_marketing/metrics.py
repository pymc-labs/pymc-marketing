    """Compute the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) for each observation.

    The CRPS — Continuous Ranked Probability Score — is a score function that compares a
    single ground truth value to a Cumulative Distribution Function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like
        The ground truth values.
    y_pred : array-like
        The predicted values. It is expected that y_pred has one extra sample
        dimension on the left.

    Returns
    -------
    array-like
        The CRPS for each observation.

    Examples
    --------
    .. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np

        from pymc_marketing.metrics import per_observation_crps

        # y_true shape is (3,)
        y_true = np.array([1, 1, 1])
