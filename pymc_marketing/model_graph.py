def deterministics_to_flat(model: pm.Model, names: list[str]) -> pm.Model:
    """Replace all specified Deterministic nodes in a pm.Model with Flat.

    This is useful to capture some state from a model and to then sample from
    the model using that state. For example, capturing the mean of a distribution
    or a value of a deterministic variable.

    See :class:`pymc_marketing.mmm.hsgp.SoftPlusHSGP` for an example of how this
    is used to keep a variable centered around 1.0 during sampling but stay continuous
    with new values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : pm.Model
        PyMC model to be transformed
    names : list[str]
        Names of the deterministic variables to be replaced by flat

    Returns
    -------
    new_model : pm.Model
        New model with all priors replaced by flat priors

    Examples
    --------
    Replace single Deterministic with Flat and sample as if it were zeros.
