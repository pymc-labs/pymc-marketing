    """HSGP keyword arguments for the time-varying prior.

    See [1]_ and [2]_ for the theoretical background on the Hilbert Space Gaussian Process (HSGP).
    See , [6]_ for a practical guide through the method using code examples.
    See the :class:`~pymc.gp.HSGP` class for more information on the Hilbert Space Gaussian Process in PyMC.
    We also recommend the following resources for a more practical introduction to HSGP: [3]_, [4]_, [5]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : int
        Number of basis functions. Default is 200.
    L : float, optional
        Extent of basis functions. Set this to reflect the expected range of in+out-of-sample data
        (considering that time-indices are zero-centered).Default is `X_mid * 2` (identical to `c=2` in HSGP).
        By default it is None.
    eta_lam : float
        Exponential prior for the variance. Default is 1.
    ls_mu : float
        Mean of the inverse gamma prior for the lengthscale. Default is 5.
    ls_sigma : float
        Standard deviation of the inverse gamma prior for the lengthscale. Default is 5.
    cov_func : ~pymc.gp.cov.Covariance, optional
        Gaussian process Covariance function. By default it is None.
