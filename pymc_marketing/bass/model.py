r"""Bass diffusion model for product adoption.

Adapted from Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_diffusion_model

The Bass diffusion model, developed by Frank Bass in 1969, is a mathematical model that describes
the process of how new products get adopted in a population over time. It is widely used in
marketing, forecasting, and innovation studies to predict the adoption rates of new products
and technologies.

Mathematical Formulation
-----------------------
The model is based on a differential equation that describes the rate of adoption:

.. math::

    \frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} = p + q F(t)

Where:

- :math:`F(t)` is the installed base fraction (cumulative proportion of adopters)
- :math:`f(t)` is the rate of change of the installed base fraction (:math:`f(t) = F'(t)`)
- :math:`p` is the coefficient of innovation or external influence
- :math:`q` is the coefficient of imitation or internal influence

The solution to this equation gives the adoption curve:

.. math::

    F(t) = \frac{1 - e^{-(p+q)t}}{1 + (\frac{q}{p})e^{-(p+q)t}}

The adoption rate at time t is given by:

.. math::

    f(t) = (p + q F(t))(1 - F(t))

Key Parameters
-------------
The model has three main parameters:

- :math:`m`: Market potential (total number of eventual adopters)
- :math:`p`: Coefficient of innovation (external influence) - typically 0.01-0.03
- :math:`q`: Coefficient of imitation (internal influence) - typically 0.3-0.5

Parameter Interpretation
-----------------------
- A higher :math:`p` value indicates stronger external influence (advertising, marketing)
- A higher :math:`q` value indicates stronger internal influence (word-of-mouth, social interactions)
- The ratio :math:`q/p` indicates the relative strength of internal vs. external influences
- The peak of adoption occurs at time :math:`t^* = \frac{\ln(q/p)}{p+q}`

Applications
-----------
The Bass model has been applied to forecast the adoption of various products and technologies:

- Consumer durables (TVs, refrigerators)
- Technology products (smartphones, software)
- Pharmaceutical products
- Entertainment products
- Services and subscriptions

This implementation provides a Bayesian version of the Bass model using PyMC, allowing for:
- Uncertainty quantification through prior distributions
- Hierarchical modeling for multiple products/markets
- Extension to incorporate additional factors

Examples
--------
Create a basic Bass model for multiple products:

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import pymc as pm

    # Create time points - 3 years of monthly data
    n_dates = 12 * 3
    dates = pd.date_range(start="2020-01-01", periods=n_dates, freq="MS")
    t = np.arange(n_dates)

    # Define coordinates for multiple products
    coords = {"T": t, "product": ["A", "B", "C"]}

    # Define priors
    priors = {
        "m": Prior("DiracDelta", c=10_000),  # Market potential
        "p": Prior("Beta", alpha=13.85, beta=692.43, dims="product"),  # Innovation coefficient
        "q": Prior("Beta", alpha=36.2, beta=54.4),  # Imitation coefficient
        "likelihood": Prior("Poisson", dims=("T", "product")),
    }

    # Create the Bass model
    model = create_bass_model(t, observed=None, priors=priors, coords=coords)

    # Sample from the prior predictive distribution
    with model:
        idata = pm.sample_prior_predictive()

    # Plot the adoption curves
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(10, 6))
    idata.prior["y"].pipe(plot_curve, {"T"}, axes=axes)
    plt.subtitle("Bass Model Prior Predictive Adoption Curves")
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

    r"""Define a Bass diffusion model for product adoption forecasting.

    This function creates a Bayesian Bass diffusion model using PyMC to forecast
    product adoption over time. The Bass model captures both innovation (external
    influence like advertising) and imitation (internal influence like word-of-mouth)
    effects in the adoption process.

    The model includes the following components:

    - Market potential 'm': Total number of eventual adopters
    - Innovation coefficient 'p': Measures external influence
    - Imitation coefficient 'q': Measures internal influence
    - Adopters over time: Number of new adopters at each time point
    - Innovators: Adopters influenced by external factors
    - Imitators: Adopters influenced by previous adopters
    - Peak adoption time: When adoption rate reaches maximum

    Parameters
    ----------
    t : pt.TensorLike
        Time points for which the adoption is modeled.
    observed : pt.TensorLike | None
        Observed adoption data at each time point. If None, only
        prior predictive sampling is possible.

        Dictionary containing priors for:
        - 'm': Market potential prior

        - 'q': Imitation coefficient prior
        - 'likelihood': Observation likelihood model
    coords : dict[str, Any]
        Coordinate values for dimensions in the model, including
        'date' for the time dimension and any other dimensions
        included in the prior specifications.

    sampling, and posterior predictive checks to forecast product adoption.
