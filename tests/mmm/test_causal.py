"""Tests for :mod:`pymc_marketing.mmm.causal`.

The causal-discovery tooling — ``TBFPC``, ``BuildModelFromDAG``, and
``TestResult`` — now lives in the standalone ``pathmc`` library and is
exhaustively tested there. This module therefore covers only the dowhy-based
:class:`CausalGraphModel` that pymc-marketing still owns, plus a wiring check
that the re-exported discovery names resolve to their pathmc implementations.
