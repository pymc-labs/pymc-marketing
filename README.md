## Quick Installation Guide for Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) & CLV

To dive into MMM and CLV analytics, set up a specialized Python environment, `marketing_env`, via conda-forge:

```bash
conda create -c conda-forge -n marketing_env pymc-marketing
conda activate marketing_env
```

For a comprehensive installation guide, refer to the [official PyMC installation documentation](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/latest/installation.html).

### Docker

We provide a `Dockerfile` to build a Docker image for PyMC-Marketing so that is accessible from a Jupyter Notebook. See [here](scripts/docker/README.md) for more details.

## In-depth Bayesian Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) in PyMC

Leverage our Bayesian MMM API to tailor your marketing strategies effectively. Leveraging on top of the research article [Jin, Yuxue, et al. “Bayesian methods for media mix modeling with carryover and shape effects.” (2017)](https://research.google/pubs/pub46001/),  and extending it by integrating the expertise from core PyMC developers, our API provides:

### MMM Quickstart

```python
import pandas as pd

from pymc_marketing.mmm import (
    GeometricAdstock,
    LogisticSaturation,
    MMM,
)

data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pymc-labs/pymc-marketing/main/data/mmm_example.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(data_url, parse_dates=["date_week"])

mmm = MMM(
    adstock=GeometricAdstock(l_max=8),
    saturation=LogisticSaturation(),
    date_column="date_week",
    channel_columns=["x1", "x2"],
    control_columns=[
        "event_1",
        "event_2",
        "t",
    ],
    yearly_seasonality=2,
)
```

Initiate fitting and get a visualization of some of the outputs with:

```python
X = data.drop("y",axis=1)
y = data["y"]
mmm.fit(X,y)
mmm.plot_components_contributions();
```

![](docs/source/_static/mmm_plot_components_contributions.png)

Once the model is fitted, we can further optimize our budget allocation as we are including diminishing returns and carry-over effects in our model.

## Unlock Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) with PyMC

Understand and optimize your customer's value with our **CLV models**. Our API supports various types of CLV models, catering to both contractual and non-contractual settings, as well as continuous and discrete transaction modes.

- [CLV Quickstart](https://pymc-marketing.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/clv/clv_quickstart.html)
- [BG/NBD model](https://pymc-marketing.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/clv/bg_nbd.html)
- [Pareto/NBD model](https://pymc-marketing.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/clv/pareto_nbd.html)
- [Gamma-Gamma model](https://pymc-marketing.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/clv/gamma_gamma.html)
- [Shifted Beta-Geo model](https://www.pymc-marketing.io/en/stable/notebooks/clv/sBG.html)

### Examples

|                | **Non-contractual**      | **Contractual**         |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Continuous** | online purchases         | ad conversion time      |
| **Discrete**   | concerts & sports events | recurring subscriptions |

### CLV Quickstart

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from pymc_marketing import clv

data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pymc-labs/pymc-marketing/main/data/clv_quickstart.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(data_url)
data["customer_id"] = data.index

beta_geo_model = clv.BetaGeoModel(data=data)

beta_geo_model.fit()
```

Once fitted, we can use the model to predict the number of future purchases for known customers, the probability that they are still alive, and get various visualizations plotted.
