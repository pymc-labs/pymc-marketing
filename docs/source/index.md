## Bayesian Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) in PyMC

Leverage our Bayesian MMM API to tailor your marketing strategies effectively. Leveraging on top of the research article [Jin, Yuxue, et al. ‚ÄúBayesian methods for media mix modeling with carryover and shape effects.‚Äù (2017)](https://research.google/pubs/pub46001/),  and extending it by integrating the expertise from core PyMC developers, our API provides:

Understand and optimize your customer's value with our **CLV models**. Our API supports various types of CLV models, catering to both contractual and non-contractual settings, as well as continuous and discrete transaction modes:

- [CLV Quickstart](https://pymc-marketing.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/clv/clv_quickstart.html)
- [BG/NBD model](https://pymc-marketing.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/clv/bg_nbd.html)
- [Pareto/NBD model](https://pymc-marketing.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/clv/pareto_nbd.html)
- [Gamma-Gamma model](https://pymc-marketing.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/clv/gamma_gamma.html)
- [Shifted Beta-Geo model](https://www.pymc-marketing.io/en/stable/notebooks/clv/sBG.html)

Each of these models is tailored to different types of data and business scenarios:

|                | **Non-contractual**      | **Contractual**         |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Continuous** | online purchases         | ad conversion time      |
