    "# MMMs and Pearl's ladder of causal inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore [Judea Pearl's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_Pearl) causal ladder and how it can be applied to solve business problems with Media Mix Models (MMMs). We will assume familiarity with the basics of MMMs in order to focus on causal inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Pearl's causal ladder?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearl's causal ladder outlines 3 successively more sophisticated levels of causal reasoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prediction / Forecasting / Association:** With the first step on the ladder, we could use a model to predict future sales based on past data. This does not involve causal reasoning, just prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Intervention:** The second step on the ladder involves using a model to predict the future effect of an intervention. It is similar to step 1 in that it involves prediction/forecasting, but it is different in that we consider a potential intervention that will have effects in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Counterfactuals:** The third and final step on the ladder could use a to estimate how the world _would_ have been different if we had taken a different action in the past. This is clearly different from the first two steps in that it is retrospective. It is also the most sophisticated level of causal reasoning - it involves learning about the world from historical data, but then imagining how the world _could_ have been different in a counterfactual scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Causal Ladder](../../_static/causal_ladder.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The image of Pearl's causal ladder appears in the book \"[The Book of Why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Why)\" by Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie. The book is a great introduction to causal inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The do-operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The do-operator is a key concept in Pearl's causal inference framework and is required for causal reasoning on steps 2 or 3 of the causal ladder. It is used to denote interventions in a system. If we think about our modeling efforts as describing a Bayesian structural causal model, then the do-operator is used to denote the effect of changing a variable in the model. Any incoming causal links to that node are severed, and the node is set to the value specified by the do-operator.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{seealso}\n",
    "For practical examples of the do-operator in action, the following resources are useful:\n",
    "* [Causal analysis with PyMC: Answering \"What If?\" with the new do operator](https://www.pymc-labs.com/blog-posts/causal-analysis-with-pymc-answering-what-if-with-the-new-do-operator/)\n",

    "## How does this help us solve business problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we've recapped the causal ladder, let's consider how it can help us solve business problems, specifically with MMMs. Let's look at a few example use cases and see what level of the causal ladder they correspond to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Predicting future sales:** A very common use-case of MMM's is to make forecasts of our outcome variable (e.g. sales). This can be particularly useful ingredient in demand forecasting for example. Once we've trained an MMM on historical data we can use the MMM to predict future sales (out of sample prediction) based on past sales, marketing spend, and other predictor variables. This would correspond to step 1 on the causal ladder - we are forecasting into the future but not considering any changes to our marketing strategy. See our docs {ref}`mmm_budget_allocation_example` for a worked example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Optimizing existing marketing spend:** A more sophisticated use-case of MMM's is to use the model to predict the effect of different marketing strategies (see our docs {ref}`mmm_time_slice_cross_validation`). For example, we could use it to predict the effect of various different changes to media spend. We could then predict the expected sales under these scenarios and pick a scenario which maximises sales or profit, for example. This corresponds to step 2 on the causal ladder - intervention. This is a more sophisticated level of causal reasoning, as it involves prediction, but in the presence of an altered marketing strategies (i.e. interventions). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Planning an increase in marketing spend:** Let's say our business wants to gain more market share and has decided to increase marketing spend by 20% over the next quarter. You are tasked with proposing a number of different future media spend strategies that you think will cause the largest increase in sales. This corresponds to step 2 on the causal ladder - intervention. We are predicting the effect of an intervention (increasing media spend) on sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Evaluating the impact of a previous increase in marketing spend:** Let's say our business increased TV spend by 20% over the last quarter and we want to know what impact this had on sales. We can answer this question by comparing what _actually_ happened, to what we think _would have happened_ under some alternative imagined counterfactual scenario such as not increasing TV spend by 20%. Importantly, this counterfactual reasoning is _retrospective_, but it uses the knowledge we have learnt from all observations so far. This corresponds to step 3 on the causal ladder - counterfactual inference. We are learning from historical data, but then imagining how the world _could_ have been different in a counterfactual scenario. So this involves retrospective causal reasoning."

    "In this notebook, we've recapped Pearl's causal ladder and seen how different levels of causal reasoning can be applied to solve business problems with MMMs. We've seen how MMMs can be used to predict future sales (Step 1), optimize marketing spend (Step 2), and evaluate the impact of marketing campaigns (Step 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw how counterfactual inference can be used to estimate the causal impact of marketing campaigns. In this notebook we used \"God Mode\" to simulate a world where we had knowledge of the counterfactual scenario - but in real world use cases we may have to estimate what the media spend would have been had we not run a marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the methods demonstrated here can be used in other ways. An immediate one that comes to mind is to evaluate the causal impact of our past media spending by comparing it to a counterfactual scenario of zero media spend (on one or multiple channels), for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope you see how this can be a powerful tool for businesses to understand the impact of their marketing efforts and make data-driven decisions."
