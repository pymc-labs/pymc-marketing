# Why embrace open source?

In recent years, there has been a significant shift across many data-intensive industries to build upon open source foundations. There are several advantages in building your marketing data science stack on an open source core:

## Cost savings
 Avoid paying for proprietary software licenses.

## Avoid vendor lock-in
Keep flexibility and control, with the ability to switch to other options or to customise your data science models on top of an open source core.

## Flexibility and customization
Open source software is customizable and can be tailored to meet the specific needs of your business. This allows you to create a data science stack that is uniquely suited to your business and can give you a competitive advantage.

## In-housing
There are pro’s and con’s of running your marketing analytics [in-house](https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/in-housing-everything-need-know/1492428) versus outsourcing through external marketing agencies bespoke consultancies. But if you were going to in-house, it makes sense to build your data science stack on an open core - it allows your data science team to focus on customisation for *your* business rather than building and maintaining the foundations that others have already built.

## Innovation
Open source software is often at the forefront of innovation in data science, with new tools and techniques being developed and shared by the community. By building your data science stack on an open source core, you can stay up-to-date with the latest advances in the field and take advantage of new developments and improvements as they arise.

## Community support
PyMC-Marketing and [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/) (the Bayesian engine that powers PyMC-Marketing) are supported by a large, active community of developers who contribute to the development of these libraries and provide support and guidance to users. For example the [the PyMC-Marketing Discussions on Github](https://github.com/pymc-labs/pymc-marketing/discussions) allows members of our community to connect with and ask questions of peers, core developers, and members of [PyMC Labs](https://www.pymc-labs.com).  The [PyMC Discouse](https://discourse.pymc.io) is a similar forum for users of PyMC (the engine that powers PyMC-Marketing). This thriving community can be invaluable for businesses that don't have the resources to hire their own team of data scientists.

## Talent acquisition and onboarding
Using open source software as a foundation for your data science stack can help attract top talent to your company. Developers and data scientists are often drawn to companies that use cutting-edge tools and contribute to the larger open source community.
