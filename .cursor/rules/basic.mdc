- Run pre-commit everytime you create or modify a file.
- Temporary or test scripts that are not meant to be commited should be created in the sandbox folder

When running Python commands (pytest, pre-commit, python), prefer using the
absolute path to the executable inside the active environment's bin/ directory
rather than relying on PATH. Discover it with `which python` (or `where python`
on Windows) inside an already-activated environment (conda, venv, pyenv, etc.).
