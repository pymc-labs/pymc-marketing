- Run pre-commit everytime you create or modify a file.
- Temporary or test scripts that are not meant to be commited should be created in the sandbox folder

For Python commands in the pymc-marketing project, use absolute path
/Users/coltallen/miniforge3/envs/pymc-marketing-dev/bin/ for executables
(pytest, pre-commit, python). Do not rely on conda activate or PATH.
